# Puppy_Plaza

UGA Hackathon 2019

A game developed to learn the JavaFX api better. The game consisted of a grid that highlights 
sections based on cursor location. When the cursor is clicked, a small animated sprite is placed
on screen. The sprite moves around and generally looks cute. Frame rate for sprite animation and 
motion was locked to 60 fps.
